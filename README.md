# Linear Regression Bike Sharing
> The Corona epidemic has caused dramatic revenue declines for US bike-sharing company BoomBikes. 
> The company has created a business plan to better grasp the demand for shared bikes following a pandemic in order to bounce back 
> Once the situation gets better, the scheme seeks to meet people's needs and generate notable profits. 
> The corporation will borrow bikes from docks under computer control and bring them back to another pier.

# Business Goal:
> Once the Covid-19 quarantine ends, BoomBikes wants to know how much demand shared bikes create in the American market. 
> BoomBikes hires a consultancy firm to identify key variables and understand the factors influencing demand. 
> By means of meteorological surveys and people's preferences, compile a report on daily bike needs over the American market. 
> By modeling the need for shared bikes with independent variables, managers can modify their business plan to satisfy consumer demand and customer expectations.
