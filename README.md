# Linear Regression Bike Sharing
> The Corona epidemic has caused dramatic revenue declines for US bike-sharing company BoomBikes. 
> The company has created a business plan to better grasp the demand for shared bikes following a pandemic in order to bounce back 
> Once the situation gets better, the scheme seeks to meet people's needs and generate notable profits. 
> The corporation will borrow bikes from docks under computer control and bring them back to another pier.

# Business Goal:
> Once the Covid-19 quarantine ends, BoomBikes wants to know how much demand shared bikes create in the American market. 
> BoomBikes hires a consultancy firm to identify key variables and understand the factors influencing demand. 
> By means of meteorological surveys and people's preferences, compile a report on daily bike needs over the American market. 
> By modeling the need for shared bikes with independent variables, managers can modify their business plan to satisfy consumer demand and customer expectations.

## General Information
- This project aims to develop a Multiple Linear Regression model to forecast shared bike demand within a bike-sharing system. 
- The project intends to maximize the business plan for a bike-sharing firm and grasp all factors impacting the rental count.

## Data Set Applied
- This study makes use of a U.S. bike-sharing system's dataset. It covers details on daily bike rentals, the state of the weather, time-related characteristics, and whether today is a working day or a holiday.
- The primary features consist in:
Overall rental count (target variable)
Dates: Year, Month, Weekday, Season
- Temperatures, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions:
Working Day, Holiday: Type Indicator Day

## **Key Findings & Conclusions**
### **1. Temperature Strongly Affects Bike Rentals**  
- Higher temperatures lead to increased bike demand.  
- Extreme weather (heavy rain or snow) significantly reduces rentals.  

### **2. Increasing Trend in Bike Rentals Over Time**  
- The **year-over-year trend** indicates growing adoption of bike-sharing services.  
- Bike rentals in **2019 were significantly higher than in 2018**, showing increased customer preference.  

### **3. Seasonal Impact on Demand**  
- **Peak season:** **Summer and fall** have the highest rental counts.  
- **Low season:** **Spring and winter** show a noticeable drop in demand.  
- Seasonal variations suggest that biking is **preferred in moderate and warm weather conditions**.  

### **4. Negative Impact of Wind Speed & Humidity**  
- Higher **humidity** discourages bike rentals, possibly due to discomfort.  
- Strong **winds** reduce rentals, likely due to difficulty in riding.  

### **5. Weekends & Holidays Show Different Rental Patterns**  
- **Working days still see significant bike rentals**, indicating heavy usage for **commuting**.  
- **Weekends & holidays** exhibit different demand patterns, likely due to leisure biking.  

### **6. Feature Selection & Model Optimization**  
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) + Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** were used to remove **multicollinearity** and select the best predictors.  
- Unnecessary variables like **â€˜atempâ€™ (adjusted temperature)** were dropped due to their **high correlation with temperature**.  

### **7. Handling Outliers for Better Model Accuracy**  
- Extreme values in **temperature, humidity, and wind speed** were **removed using IQR filtering**.  
- This helped improve model stability and accuracy.  

### **8. Strong Model Performance**  
- **Train RÂ²:** **0.84** | **Test RÂ²:** **0.83** â†’ The model generalizes well without overfitting.  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** **~578**  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** **~803**  
- The model has **good predictive power** and captures demand variations effectively.  

### **9. Model Assumption Validations**  
âœ… **Normality of Residuals:** Checked using **Q-Q plots and histograms**. Residuals follow a **normal distribution**.  
âœ… **No Multicollinearity:** Verified using **VIF analysis**, ensuring independent variables do not have strong correlations.  
âœ… **Homoscedasticity Confirmed:** **Residual plots** show no systematic pattern, proving that variance remains constant.  

## **Business Implications**
ðŸš² **Optimized Bike Distribution:** Companies can **allocate bikes efficiently** based on predicted demand in different seasons and weather conditions.  
ðŸš² **Seasonal Pricing Strategies:** Adjusting **rental pricing** based on peak and low-demand seasons can maximize profits.  
ðŸš² **Weather-Based Forecasting:** Integrating **real-time weather data** can improve **demand predictions** and **inventory management**.  
ðŸš² **Expansion Opportunities:** The **growing trend in bike rentals** suggests **potential business growth**, encouraging further investment in bike-sharing infrastructure.
